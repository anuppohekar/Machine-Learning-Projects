Portfolio of Machine Learning Projects 

LogisticRegression.ipynb -- Use of Logistic Regression to solve the diabetes dataset, in which the objective is to predict if patient has diabetes
                           or not, based on features in the dataset. 

SVM_TitanicDataSet.ipynb -- SVM (Support Vector Machine) is use to solve classification and regression problem

Movie_rating-small.ipynb -- Recommendation System 

NaiveBayesTheorem.ipynb -- Appying Naive bayes theorem to Diabetes dataset, In Naive bayse theorem eachone of the features contribute independently for final      output. It is used when all the columns are categorical columns 
                          
SVM_TitanicDataSet.ipynb -- Using SVM(Support Vector Machine) for Tiatanic dataset svclassifier = SVC(kernel = "rbf"). Different SVM algorithm use different tyoe of                            kernal functions, e.g linear, nonlinear, polynomial etc.   

KNNalgorithm.ipynb -- KNN(K Nearest Neighbor) implementation with Riding Mowers dataset, using KNeighborClassifier() algorithm. The biggest use of KNN is for search application. 

BostonDecisionTreeDis.ipynb -- Predicting Boston house price with regression using Decision Tree Classifier
