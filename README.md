Portfolio of Machine Learning Projects 

BostonDecisionTreeDis.ipynb -- Predicting Boston house price with regression using Decision Tree Classifier.

KNNalgorithm.ipynb -- KNN(K Nearest Neighbor) implementation with Riding Mowers dataset, using KNeighborClassifier() algorithm. The biggest use of KNN is for search application. 

LogisticRegression.ipynb -- Use of Logistic Regression to solve the diabetes dataset, in which the objective is to predict if patient has diabetes
                           or not, based on features in the dataset. 
                           
NaiveBayesTheorem.ipynb -- Appying Naive bayes theorem to Diabetes dataset, In Naive bayse theorem eachone of the features contribute independently for final      output. It is used when all the columns are categorical columns.  

PCA.ipynb -- PCA(Principle Component Analysis) implementation using IRIS dataset, which identify the combination of attributes that account for the most variance in the data.


RandomForest.ipynb -- Using RandomForestClassifier on Titanic dataset to predict who will survive and who will die. 

SVM_TitanicDataSet.ipynb -- Using SVM(Support Vector Machine) for Tiatanic dataset svclassifier = SVC(kernel = "rbf"). Different SVM algorithm use different type of                            kernal functions, e.g linear, nonlinear, polynomial etc. SVM is used to solve classification and regression problem.  

Movie_rating-small.ipynb -- Building a recommendation system to identify movies similar to Forrest Gump(1994).
